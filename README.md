 Have you ever forgotten your password? Oh, what am I saying, of course you have!
 With websites requiring different formats for each password (Like 1 Uppercase letter and 1 number or atleast 15 characters), It's hard to remember all your passwords. 
 With our project LockSmith, you only need to remember one.
 
 ## getting started With eclipse
